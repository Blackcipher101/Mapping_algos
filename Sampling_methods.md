# Sampling

## Visbility graph
join all vertices of the obstaclales and the corner points of the config space and all the vertices are nodes and the apply the mapping algos


## trapzoidal 
at all vetices make a line paralel to y axis and each trapeze is a node


## Collsion 
each point is chechked with collsion checker function and if it returns a free space its a node the colision checker takes in a piont as a input
